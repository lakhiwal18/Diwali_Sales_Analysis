# Project Description
In this project, we aim to gain insights from a dataset that includes information about customers, their purchases, and related attributes. The main goal is to perform data analysis and visualization using Python, with a focus on exploring patterns and trends in customer behavior.The project utilizes the following Python libraries and tools:
* Numpy: For working with array and numerical computation 
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Jupyter Notebook: For creating and running the analysis scripts.

  # Project Learnings:
* Performed data cleaning and manipulation
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn libraries
* Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states,occupations,age groups and gender.
* Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

* User_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
* Cust_name: Customer's name.
* Product_ID: Unique identifier for each product.
* Gender: Customer's gender.
* Age Group: Age group of the customer.
* Age: Customer's age.
* Marital_Status: Customer's marital status.
* State: State where the customer resides.
* Zone: Zone or region where the customer is located.
* Occupation: Customer's occupation.
* Product_Category: Category of the purchased product.
* Orders: Number of orders placed by the customer.
* Amount: Total amount spent by the customer.
## The dataset is included in this repository
